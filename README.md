# Intro to version control

## Useful references

- [the git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is available free online and is an extremely thorough resource for all things `git`.
- [the Mastering Git](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/mastering-git) course by thoughtbot is a great way to learn some more advanced `git`.

## Why use version control?

- facilitates collaboration
- allows rollback to earlier working versions
- allows devs to look back at the project history

## Version control systems

There are a couple of version control systems you might hear about:

- `git`
- `mercurial`
- `subversion`
- `perforce`

But at this point `git` is the most popular (and best!).

## Basic concepts

- branches
- commits
- snapshots

## Exercises

1. Make sure you have `git` installed locally
2. Check out the repository locally and have a look around the files
3. Install a python virtual environment and try and run the tests locally
4. Now let's write a new test! Add in the optional `last_name` parameter and write a test (bonus points for doing it TDD)
5. Check out a branch and commit that change
6. Push that branch up to the remote repo and create a PR
7. Merge that in after approval
8. Clean up - pull down the new main branch and delete your local feature branch
9. Tada! You've added a new feature like a pro!
