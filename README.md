# Intro to version control

## Useful references

- [the git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is available free online and is an extremely thorough resource for all things `git`.
- [the Mastering Git](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/mastering-git) course by thoughtbot is a great way to learn some more advanced `git`.

## Why use version control?

- facilitates collaboration
- allows rollback to earlier working versions
- allows devs to look back at the project history

## Version control systems

There are a couple of version control systems you might hear about:

- `git`
- `mercurial`
- `subversion`
- `perforce`

But at this point `git` is the most popular (and best!).

## Basic concepts

- branches
- commits
- snapshots
